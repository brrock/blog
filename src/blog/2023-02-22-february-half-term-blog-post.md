Welcome to my February half term blog post. In this post there are some of the things I got up to in this half tem holiday. Video: [](https://youtu.be/de_V6P0RVbg)[go](https://youtu.be/de_V6P0RVbg)We had a great week.

### **Rock painting**

We painted rocks with acrylic paint pens, we sprayed them with a special varnish spray and then put them in our garden.

### **Pasta making**

We used this recipe <https://youtu.be/x1zYe3b359M> we didn't have the sauce though, instead we made Tilly Ramsay's meatballs and tomato sauce. My brother had it with pesto, we both loved it and will try again with eggs next.
