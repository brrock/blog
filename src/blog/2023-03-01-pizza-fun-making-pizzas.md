I love pizza! I love making pizza too, doesn't everyone? When we are short of time we like to use a recipe without yeast as you don't have to let the dough rise.  We used a recipe my Aunty told us about with self raising flour and yogurt! I don't actually like eating yogurt but it is good in this pizza as you can't taste it at all.  This recipe makes a slightly thicker base so if you want it thinner then make sure you roll it or stretch it a lot.  It can get quite sticky, so use a lot of flour! 

We like to use the pizza express passata but you can use the one in this recipe or any other. I like sweetcorn, cheddar and mozzarella cheeses. My brother likes olives!
