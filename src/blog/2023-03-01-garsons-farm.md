My family and I have been going to Garsons Pick Your Own Farm ever since I was a one year old.  I really love it there, its relaxing being in the countryside and I enjoy picking all the different crops. During this visit we picked French beans, beetroot, carrots, cauliflower, corn on the cob, raspberries and apples! Sometimes we go out for lunch in the cafe in the Garsons Garden Centre, I always have pasta with garlic bread and a fizzy juice - I love it there.



They even have flowers to pick - sunflowers (see below) and dahlias too. When we got home I cleaned the beans and trimmed them with scissors before my Mummy boiled them to eat for dinner.  My Daddy washed and peeled the carrots and beetroot to roast them in the oven at 180c  fan or gas mark 6 for 45 minutes.  We served them with roast chicken and rice. My brother also had a corn on the cob. My brother and I don't really like eating the vegetables yet but we will do one day my Mummy says! 



The raspberries were yum and we picked so many we froze some to eat in smoothies. Please see below a recipe for raspberry jam that we made with last time's batch.
