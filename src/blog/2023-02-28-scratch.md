Scratch is a program that lets you make a computer code with blocks.I Love computingðŸ’» ! Open here:

Follow the steps below to make your own scratch conversation code:



1. Select your sprite (this is an animated 2D figure you will code and control) - you can use the standard orange cat (this is a sprite) OR to chose your own spite, I always delete the shown one at the beginning.Â To delete it you need to right click on the small sprite in the blue and white box and select delete.Â  To select the new sprite, click on the blue circle with a white cat's face on that has a + on it and you will be take to all the sprite options. You can choose whatever you like.



2. To make a conversation you will need to add another sprite, repeat the adding sprite step above (obviously do not delete the one you've just chosen)!



3. Click on the first sprite you chose and go to the left hand side tool bar and select 'Events' add your first code 'block' - this needs to be the 'when (image of green flag) clicked'Â 



4. Repeat step 3 for the other sprite you chose by clicking on it and doing the above step.



5. Now move to 'Looks' (a purple spot) on the left hand side tool bar and select 'Say hello for 2 seconds' and drag it directly under the last code block -over write thatÂ numberÂ  with 1Â (it needs to be touching it from below - see image later).



6.Now select your other sprite and select 'controls' (an orange spot) on the left hand side tool bar and choose 'Wait for 1 second' - and drag this code block under the green flag block like you did for the first sprite.



7.Now stay with this second sprite and repeat step 5, so the sprite can say hello back to the first sprite.



8.Return to sprite 1 and repeat step 6 to allow a pause in the conversation.



9. Go back to the other sprite and go back to 'Looks' and select 'Say hello for 1 seconds' again and drag it underneath the other code blocks. Change to text to 'How are you?'Â 



10. Repeat step 6 (switching sprites).



11. Stay with this sprite and select from 'Looks' the same code block as in step 9 but overtype it with 'I am great thanks"Â 



12. Repeat step 6 (switchingÂ sprites)



13.Â  Go to 'Looks' (a purple spot) on the left hand side tool bar and select 'Say hello for 2 seconds'Â  over write that text with 'bye'Â (stay in that sprite)Â 



14.Â Repeat step 6 (switchingÂ sprites)Â 



15.Â Repeat step 13Â (stay in that sprite)Â 



16. To change your background, go to the right hand side tool box (underneath the sprite images) and under 'stage' there is a 'backdrop' section with a blue selection button - click on this and all the options will be shown. Choose the backdrop you like and it will automatically show when you click on it.



17. To save your conversation (not essential but good if you want to look back at it) , go to 'file' on the top toolbar and 'save to your computer' and choose where you want to save it.



18. To play your conversation, click on the green flag.
