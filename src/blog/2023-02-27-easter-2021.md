Welcome to Easter, in this post I'll show you what I have done this Easter so far!

### *Chocolate tempering*

We tempered white (which we food coloured) and dark chocolate. Tempering makes the chocolate nice and shiny. (See video above.)

### *DECO MAKING*

We followed this [GUIDE](https://www.bakerross.co.uk/craft-ideas/kids/string-egg-decoration/) and we put the string around 2 plastic bowls to make lovely Easter egg bowls.



*Cool food!*

We made CHEATS 'Churros' and cut out pastry with a bunny cutter.



We also made bunny pancakes ([see link to banana pancakes](https://brossblog.netlify.app/blog/2023-02-24-pancake-making/)) by making shapes in the pan and offer laying the shapes to finish.
